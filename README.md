# API Proxy Server
A server to hide api keys

This was something I made that can be customized to hide API keys. Simply just append the API key to the URL.

## Warning
Add some kind of verification to make sure any request performs an intended action. Even you need all of the functionality of the API, I stil reccomend this becuase you don't want future vulnerabilties if the API is updated with more sensitive routes.
